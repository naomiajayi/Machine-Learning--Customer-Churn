# Machine-Learning--Customer-Churn
This project uses machine learning to predict customer churn for a telecom company using over 7,000 customer records. Logistic regression, decision trees, and KNN models analyze demographics, service usage, and billing data to identify churn risk and provide insights that help businesses improve retention strategies and reduce revenue loss.
